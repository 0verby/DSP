# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Jekyll site to GitHub Pages

    # The Go version to download (if necessary) and use. Supports semver spec and ranges. Be sure to enclose this option in single quotation marks.
    go-version: # optional
    # Path to the go.mod or go.work file.
    go-version-file: # optional
    # Set this option to true if you want the action to always check for the latest available version that satisfies the version spec
    check-latest: # optional
    # Used to pull Go distributions from go-versions. Since there's a default, this is typically not supplied by the user. When running this action on github.com, the default value is sufficient. When running on GHES, you can pass a personal access token for github.com if you are experiencing rate limiting.
    token: # optional, default is ${{ github.server_url == 'https://github.com' && github.token || '' }}
    # Used to specify whether caching is needed. Set to true, if you'd like to enable caching.
    cache: # optional, default is true
    # Used to specify the path to a dependency file - go.sum
    cache-dependency-path: # optional
    # Target architecture for Go to use. Examples: x86, x64. Will use system architecture by default.
