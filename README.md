Data Science Projects - Bellevue University

## **APPLIED DATA SCIENCE**

This page is devoted to my final applied data science project class at Bellevue University. Featured on this page will include copies of my projects and resume. 

## **ABOUT ME**
I decided halfway through my career life to change the course and explore data more. The decision was based on a love for cleaning up databases and exploring and creating reports for others to understand the information more efficiently. This lead to attending Bellevue University for a bachelor's in Data Science. While proficient in word and excel from working for almost 20 years as an administrative assistant, I had very very little experience in any kind of computer language or coding experience. I am now in my last term at Bellevue and will earn my bachelor's degree shortly.
